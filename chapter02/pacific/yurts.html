        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. <br>
                    Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a <br>
                    roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and <br>
                    gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity <br>
                    and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom <br>
                    facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
            <br>                  
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for <br>
                    changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to <br>
                    bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
